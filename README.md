# Game
Hi I am Ronaldo and I built a small game in java <br>
This game is built using Java's Swing for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and AWT for handling basic graphics and user input. Swing is used for the game window and rendering, while AWT handles key events and graphics drawing. java.util provides utility classes like ArrayList for managing game entities and Random for alien image selection.
